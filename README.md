## 05_TestingGrounds
An FPS inspired by The Hunger Games. (Part of the [Learn C++ with Unreal Engine](https://www.udemy.com/unrealcourse/learn/v4/overview) course delivered by Ben Tristem via Udemy)

Eventually after completing this section, I hope I will be able to expand on it and make my own game Tesseract.
Until then I will add all of my code and asset files here as my own form of source control.

Please feel free to give me any comments or feedback.
